# Key Design Decisions

Detailed rationale and implementation notes for non-obvious behavior. Update this file when adding a new pattern or strategy.

## Detection strategy

- **Regex over AST**: All code analysis uses regex pattern matching from `src/patterns.ts`, not an AST parser. Changes to detection logic should update patterns there. The broken-links scanner (`src/scanners/broken-links.ts`) has its own link-extraction patterns separate from `patterns.ts`. The unused-files scanner (`src/scanners/unused-files.ts`) also has its own import regex that handles `from '...'`, `import('...')` (including webpack magic comments like `/* webpackChunkName */`), and `require('...')`.
- **Two-pass deletion**: Fix mode runs a second `scanUnusedExports()` pass after deleting routes to catch newly dead code. Service files (`.service.ts`) are skipped in the second pass.
- **Worker threads**: `unused-exports.ts` splits work across 2 workers for large projects (500+ files).

## Project layout & monorepo

- **Monorepo awareness**: Walks up directory tree looking for `apps/` directory; scans routes within the target app but checks references across the full monorepo root.
- **CI mode (`--all`)**: Non-interactive flag that scans all monorepo apps and exits with code 1 if any unused code is found. Suppresses interactive prompts and "Run with --fix" hints. In `--all --fix` mode, apps with 0 issues are auto-skipped so the menu opens only for apps with actionable items.
- **Default ignored folders**: `config.ts` hardcodes common folders (`node_modules`, `.next`, `.git`, `dist`, `.turbo`, `.cache`, `.vercel`, `.husky`, `.swc`, `generated`, `storybook-static`, `build`, `out`, `coverage`, `ios`, `android`) so users don't need to manually ignore them.

## Broken-links scanner

- **Static-params slug validation**: `resolveStaticParams()` parses each dynamic route's `generateStaticParams` and constrains link matches to the resolved concrete values. Supports literal arrays (`[{slug:"x"}]`), string-array `.map(...)`, `Object.keys(IDENT).map(...)`, and `IDENT.map(item => ({slug: item.field}))`. Identifier resolution follows imports across `@/` aliases and re-exports up to 5 hops, including `.json` defaults parsed directly. When the function is missing or unresolvable the scanner falls back to permissive matching to avoid false positives. So a hardcoded `<Link href="/services/foo-bar">` against `/services/[slug]/page.tsx` with a JSON-backed key set will be flagged when `foo-bar` is not in the keys.
- **Template-literal placeholder handling**: Iterator-derived links like `<Link href={`/services/${item.id}`}>` collapse to `/services/[id]`. `matchSegments()` detects `[id]`-shaped placeholder ref segments and (a) skips the static-params constraint, (b) skips literal-vs-literal comparison (so `/dashboard/[id]/[id]` matches `/dashboard/[libraryId]/enrollments`). Without this, the staticParams feature would false-flag template-literal links against constrained routes.
- **Multi-tenant route matching**: `matchesDynamicSuffix()` recognizes that `/view_seat` is valid when a route like `/tenant/[domain]/view_seat` exists. The tail (matched portion) must contain at least one literal segment — fully-dynamic tails like `[token]` are rejected to prevent false matches against arbitrary single-segment paths. Users can also manually suppress false positives via `ignore.links` in config.
- **Runtime-generated public assets**: `isRuntimeGeneratedPublicAsset()` whitelists common build-time/runtime files (`sitemap.xml`, `sitemap-*.xml`, `robots.txt`, `manifest.json/webmanifest`, `favicon.ico`, `sw.js`, `service-worker.js`) and any `/sitemap*` link when `next-sitemap.config.{js,mjs,cjs,ts}` exists or when Next.js Metadata Files (`app/sitemap.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`) are present. These files don't exist in `public/` at scan time but are valid at request time.
- **Summary visibility**: The summary table always shows an "Internal Links" row when the scanner finds links to check, displaying Total/Valid/Broken counts so users can see the feature is active even when there are 0 broken links.

## Config & filtering

- **Config `ignore.links`**: Separate from `ignore.routes` — `routes` is for API endpoints, `links` is for page-level broken-link suppression. Both are checked when filtering broken links (backward compatible).
- **`ignore.files` semantics**: Files matching `config.ignore.files` are excluded from the candidate pool (never reported as unused files or flagged for their exports) but remain in the scan graph for **reachability tracing**. The unused-files scanner adds them as implicit entry points so their imports are traced — otherwise a lib file imported only from an ignored UI wrapper or server action would be wrongly flagged. The unused-exports scanner keeps them in `referenceFiles` for the same reason. Changing this semantic breaks setups where users put UI/component folders under `ignore.files` to suppress noise while those folders still legitimately import shared utilities.

## Path & alias resolution

- **JSONC parser for tsconfig**: `readTsConfigWithExtends()` in `utils.ts` strips `//` and `/* */` comments before `JSON.parse`. The stripper is string-literal-aware — it matches full string literals as the first regex alternative and returns them unchanged, so tsconfig entries like `"@/*": ["./*"]` (which contain `/*` and `*/` sequences inside strings) are preserved. A naive non-aware stripper would corrupt the JSON and silently fall back to an empty alias map, breaking reachability for all `@/`-aliased imports beyond the root-level fallback.

## External-route detection

- **GitHub Actions workflow scanning**: `getGitHubWorkflowPaths()` in `scanner.ts` scans `.github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}` for `/api/...` references (curl commands, fetch calls, plugin configs). Routes found are marked as used with `.github/workflows` in references. In monorepos, both the app dir and repo root are checked for workflow files.
- **External route auto-detection**: `getAutoDetectedExternalRoutes()` checks `package.json` dependencies for known libraries that create external routes (next-auth → `/api/auth/**`, inngest → `/api/inngest`). These are marked as used with `(auto-detected external)` in references.

## Framework specifics

- **Framework entry-point exports**: `IGNORED_EXPORT_NAMES` in `constants.ts` includes `middleware` and `proxy` — Next.js framework entry points invoked by the runtime, not imported by user code. `proxy.ts` is the Next.js 16 replacement for `middleware.ts`. The unused-files scanner also treats both as entry points in its glob patterns.
- **Expo / React Native support**: `detectAppFramework()` in `utils.ts` reads an app's `package.json` to identify Expo/RN apps. The unused-files scanner adds Expo Router entry patterns (`_layout.tsx`, all `app/` files) when Expo is detected, so RN files aren't falsely flagged as unused. The broken-links scanner excludes source files from Expo/RN apps in monorepos to prevent Expo Router navigation patterns (e.g., `/(tabs)/home`) from being flagged as broken Next.js page links.

## NestJS

- **NestJS route usage source filtering**: `ApiReference` has a `source` field: `'http-client'` (fetch, axios, useSWR, `/api/` strings, `API_URL` env-var templates) or `'generic'` (plain string literals). In `checkRouteUsage()`, NestJS routes are only matched against `http-client` references. This prevents page navigation paths like `router.push("/super_admin/admin")` from falsely matching NestJS API route `/super_admin`. Next.js routes still match against all references (both sources) since Next.js API routes use the `/api/` prefix which is always `http-client`.
- **Empty NestJS controller detection**: `extractNestRoutes()` creates a placeholder route (with empty `methods` array) for controllers that have `@Controller()` but zero `@Get/@Post/@Put/@Delete` decorators. These appear as unused routes with no HTTP methods, flagging dead controller files.
- **NestJS migration false-positive prevention**: When a NestJS route like `/auth/login` has an `/api` prefix variation (`/api/auth/login`), and a real Next.js route exists at that path in another monorepo app, references to `/api/auth/login` are attributed to the Next.js route — not the NestJS one. After initial usage marking, a post-pass in `scan()` checks each "used" NestJS route: if a matching Next.js API route exists and no references point to the NestJS path directly (without `/api` prefix), the NestJS route is de-marked as unused. This correctly detects migrated-but-not-yet-deleted NestJS endpoints.
